State Evaluation:
  * type state = 
    (map * structs * deck * discard * robber) * player list * turn * next
    + map: I probably don't need to assign any value to the map, since it
      doesn't change throughout the game. But I will want to use the map
      (along with the robber's position) when evaluating structures.
    + settlements (part of structures)
      - All the settlements are stored in a list so it might make
        sense to do a fold operation (the accumulator would probably be a tuple
        --maybe a record, though, that'll be a pain to rebuild--consisting of
        the number of intersections processed--which tells you where the the 
        next interesection is located on the board--along with scores for each
        player).
      - The fold function might look at a particular settlement (and reference
        the accumulator to find its location) and figure out whether its been
        developed. If not, you can move on to the next entry. Otherwise, look
        at the color, the type of settlement, and the adjacent tiles (call
        adjacent_pieces on the accumulator [well, sort of--you might need to
        do some additional computation]). The color dictates who will receive
        points for the settlement, while the settlement type and adjacent tiles
        will determine its value.
      - settlement evaluation: I think the easiest thing to do is automatically
        add one point if the settlement is a Town and two points if the 
        settlement is a City. Then you can add 
          (roll_probability 
           *. average_remaining_turns *. value_of_resource_produced 
           *. amount_of_resources_produced) to the score. 
        + As a side note, I might not need to use average_remaining_turns. I
          might be able to calculate max_turns - completed_turns.

Random Ideas:
  * It may be worthwhile to only play knights when a robber is next to one of
    your cities.
    + Of course, if you can earn the largest army trophy (which in turn lets 
      you win the game), its worthwhile to play the knight card then, too.

  * Try to place settlements on interesections with a total "dot count" of 
    11-13 (i.e. place the settlement so that the tiles surrounding it add up
    to 11-13).
    + A variety of resources matters, too.

  * If you draw a monopoly card, it might make sense to do a bunch of trades
    where you give up only one type of resource. Then you can recalim all of
    those resources using the monopoly card.
